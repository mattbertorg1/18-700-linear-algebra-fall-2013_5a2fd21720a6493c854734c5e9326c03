This course offers a rigorous treatment of linear algebra, including vector spaces, systems of linear equations, bases, linear independence, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, inner products, quadratic forms, and canonical forms of matrices. Compared with [_18.06 Linear Algebra_](/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/), more emphasis is placed on theory and proofs.
